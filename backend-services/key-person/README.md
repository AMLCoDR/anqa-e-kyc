The `key-person` microservice manages data for a customer's key people. A key person
extends from identity (an individual) and exists only within the context of a customer.
That is, an identity becomes a key person when linked to a customer.

Key person records the risk an individual/identity presents to the user based on their relationship 
with the user (tenant).
