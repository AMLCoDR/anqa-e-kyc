The `reportingentity` microservice provides functions for creating, querying, and updating details of a tenant's reportingentity.

## Key take-aways
The service is used primarily by the [reportingentity](https://app.anqaml.com/reportingentity) front-end component.

On `Create`, the service calls the `subscription` service to create a Stripe subscription.
