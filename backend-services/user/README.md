The `user` microservice provides methods for interacting with user data.

## Key take-aways
The service responds to a user signing up from the website by adding them to Auth0, ActiveCampaign, and creating an organisation for them.

In the future the service should provide organisation administrators with a way to add and remove users, manage user access, etc.
