The `id-check` microservice provides functions for verifying a customer's identity.

## Key take-aways
The service proxies calls to [Data Zoo's API](https://api.datazoo.com/?version=latest) and saves results locally.

Live identity checks can only be performed by organisations that have DIA approval (and are paying customers).

Avid is charged ~$0.14 for each live identity check.

## Getting Started
If you are new to Avid development please read [this guide to getting started](https://github.com/anqaml/docs/wiki/Getting-Started).
